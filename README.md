# Office Hours 9-15 Pull Requests
The goal of this activity is to help reinforce making pull requests and answering any questions related to them.

### Instructions
1. Fork this repository on GitHub
2. Clone your forked copy of the repo to your projects folder. Remember that cloning a repo does not require making a directory for it.
3. CD into the repository.
4. Create new branch and name it ```development```.
6. Add a picture of a cat to the project.
7. Commit and Push your cat photo.

### Note
I have purposefully left out the git commands in the instructions as an additional test of your ability to use Git and GitHub.
